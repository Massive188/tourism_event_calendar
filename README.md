# tourism_event_calendar
 **Events aggregator and community calendar platform** using **web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+)**, and leveraging **cross-platform responsiveness** and **RESTful APIs**

---

### **Frontend Development:**
   - **HTML5**: Structure content semantically, including `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<main>` elements for better SEO and accessibility.
   - **CSS3**: Use modern techniques like Flexbox and Grid for layout and media queries for responsiveness. Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap can speed up development.
   - **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Utilize features like modules, arrow functions, and the Fetch API for asynchronous requests. Frameworks like React or Vue.js can enhance interactivity.

   **Key Tools**:  
   - **Preprocessors**: SCSS or PostCSS for CSS optimizations.
   - **Build Tools**: Vite or Webpack for bundling and optimization.

---

### **Cross-Platform Responsiveness:**
   - Implement **responsive design** with fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries.
   - Test across devices using tools like **BrowserStack** or **Responsive Design Mode** in Chrome DevTools.

---

### **RESTful API Integration:**
   - Use **RESTful APIs** to fetch, display, and manipulate event data. Common sources include:
     - **Google Calendar API** for pulling user-specific or public event data.
     - **Eventbrite API** for event listings and ticketing.
     - **Meetup API** for community events.

   **Integration**:
   - Handle asynchronous data with **Promises** or **Async/Await**.
   - Use **JSON** for data exchange.

---

### **Backend:**
   - **Backend Frameworks**: Use Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Node.js (Express) to create RESTful endpoints.
   - **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 for secure API access, especially for Google or social media APIs.
